# Automation Line
_**Overview**_

The **Automation Line** project integrates multiple stations with Beckhoff PLCs to facilitate assembly and material handling processes. The system is designed for seamless robotic interactions, sensor integration, and station communication using **OPC UA** protocol. Key features include:

- **Robotic Interactions:** Custom control sequences for robotic arms to perform assembly tasks.

- **Sensor Integration:** Sensors are incorporated for real-time data collection, triggering actions based on system status.

- **Station Communication:** Efficient communication between stations using OPC UA for data exchange and command control.

_**Key Features**_

- **Automation Logic:** Developed in Structured Text and Ladder Logic for precise control and sequencing of station operations.

- **HMI Integration:** An interactive Human-Machine Interface (HMI) is used for real-time monitoring and control, providing operators with visibility into system status.

- **Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs):** Coordinated AGVs ensure efficient transportation and material flow between stations, reducing manual intervention.
